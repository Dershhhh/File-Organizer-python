# Welcome to File Organizer!

Hi! This is my first mini proyect in python and is a organizer. Hope that you find it useful. 

# How make it work

You have to run organizador. py in a terminal, and is compatible with Linux and Windows. Just in Windows when you put the directory address, you have to remove the '' in the sides. It have restrictions in the directories that you put it. Example, it will not do anything in system32 folder.
